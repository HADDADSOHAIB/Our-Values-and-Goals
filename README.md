# The Knights’ Code of Chivalry 

 A knight was expected to have not only the strength and skills to face
combat in the Middle Ages but was also expected to temper this
aggressive side of a warrior with a chivalrous side to his nature.
There was one single Code of Chivalry - it was a moral system which
went beyond rules of combat and introduced the concept of
“Chivalrous conduct” or the qualities idealized by knighthood, such
as bravery, courtesy, honor, and gallantry toward women.

## MDK is based upon the following values:
1) Code is Trash (No Code is Perfect).
2) Even Trash contains Treasures ( you can learn from bad code as well as good code ).
3) To make use of trash both Trouble Makers (Developers producing code) and Minners (Developers indexing code by topic) are needed.

## MDK's main goals :

1) Stoping The Imposter Syndrome.
2) Learning by doing.
